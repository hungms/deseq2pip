\title{Run Differential Expression Analysis}
\usage{
run_diffexp(
  dds,
  org = "human",
  group_by = "Group1",
  save_data = T,
  save_dir = getwd(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dds}{DESeq2 object containing the expression data}

\item{group_by}{Column name in colData(dds) to use for grouping. Default is "Group1"}

\item{save_data}{Logical. If TRUE, saves results to TSV file. Default is TRUE}

\item{save_dir}{Directory to save the results. Default is current working directory}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to DESeq2::DESeq()}
}
\value{
A data frame containing differential expression results with columns:
- gene: gene identifier
- comparison: name of the comparison
- log2FoldChange: log2 fold change between groups
- padj: adjusted p-value
- rank: combined score (-log10(padj) * log2FoldChange)
}
\description{
This function performs differential expression analysis using DESeq2 for a comparison
between two groups. It calculates fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values for
each gene, and ranks genes based on their statistical and biological significance.

\dontrun{
# Basic differential expression analysis
res <- run_diffexp(dds)

# Differential expression analysis with custom parameters
res <- run_diffexp(dds, group_by = "Treatment", save_data = TRUE)
