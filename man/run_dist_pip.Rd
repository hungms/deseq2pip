\usage{
run_dist_pip(
  dds,

}
\arguments{
\item{dds}{DESeq2 object containing the expression data}

\item{experiment}{Name of the experiment}

\item{save_dir}{Directory where all output files will be saved. Default is current working directory}

\item{group_by}{Column name in colData(dds) to use for grouping. Default is "Group1"}

\item{batch}{Column name in colData(dds) to use for batch correction. Default is NULL}

\item{save_dir_name}{Name of the subdirectory to save files in. Default is "qc_results"}
}
\value{
The processed DESeq2 object
}
\description{
This function runs the distance analysis portion of the RNA-seq analysis pipeline,
including generating PCA and distance plots, and saving distance data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run distance pipeline with default settings
dds <- run_dist_pip(dds, experiment = "my_experiment")

# Run distance pipeline with custom settings and batch correction
dds <- run_dist_pip(dds, experiment = "my_experiment", 
                   batch = "Batch", save_dir_name = "qc_results")
}
