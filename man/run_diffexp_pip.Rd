\title{Run Differential Expression Pipeline}
\usage{
run_diffexp_pip(dds, org = "human", group_by = "Group1", save_dir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{dds}{DESeq2 object containing the expression data}

\item{group_by}{Column name in colData(dds) to use for grouping. Default is "Group1"}

\item{save_dir}{Directory where all output files will be saved. Default is current working directory}
}
\value{
A data frame containing differential expression results for all comparisons
}
\description{
This function runs the differential expression analysis portion of the RNA-seq pipeline,
including running DESeq2 and generating volcano plots.
}
\examples{
# Run differential expression pipeline
res <- run_diffexp_pip(dds)

# Run with custom grouping
res <- run_diffexp_pip(dds, group_by = "Treatment")
}
